  info: "<p>I'm a front-end / game developer with a graphic design background and this is my first project on the Crypto world. The reason I created this site is because I thought it would be fun to add a little more than just a plain image NFT, so I decided to create a place where you can do something with the NFT you own, this project is quite an accomplishment for myself.</p><p>First, because I get to draw which has always been a hobby for me, now I get to share my art with the world and second because it has given me a chance to learn so much about the crypto world and all the moving parts in it. I also get the chance to give back to those who support this project. If you would like to know more, please read the roadmap below to find more about the stretch goals on this project.  Thank you for reading!</p>",
